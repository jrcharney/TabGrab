# TabGrab

**TabGrab** is a combination of two of extension I most frequently use:
* [Copy All Urls](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-all-urls/djdmadneanknadilpjiknlnanaolmbfk?hl=en) by Vincent Par√© ([Github!](https://github.com/vincepare/CopyAllUrl_Chrome)) - Which allows the copying and pasting of tabs
* [Tab Glutton](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-glutton/ekfmaibfpamaegficfifofnlhalkbdfm?hl=en) by nsand ([Github!](https://github.com/nsand/tab-glutton)) - which lists all the tabs you have and allows you to search and close tab.

There might be a few other features added.

The motivation for this project is to try out the tutorial article ["How to Build a Chrome Extension"](https://dev.to/sunilaleti/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension-3lpj) by Sunil Aleti.

Patreon ensues.
